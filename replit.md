**🚨 CRITICAL DEBUGGING RULE 🚨**
**當用戶回報任何 BUG 或問題時，永遠只針對生產環境進行調查和修復：**
- 生產環境: `eccal.thinkwithblack.com`
- 永遠不檢查開發環境 `localhost:5000`
- 所有 API 測試都用生產環境 URL
- 所有問題分析都基於生產環境狀態
- 這是絕對不可違反的規則

**🚨 CALCULATOR GA4 FLOW 🚨**
**系統設計 - 用戶直接用主登入 Google 帳號使用 GA4，不需要連接第二個帳號：**
- 用戶用自己的 Google 帳號登入平台
- 系統直接使用該登入帳號的 Google token 調用 Google Analytics API
- `/api/analytics/properties` 返回該帳號下的所有 GA4 資源
- `/calculator` 顯示綠色卡讓用戶選擇並載入 GA 資料
- 不需要連接/授權第二個 Google 帳號
